  There are several data files in this source package, the license of
  them might be something confusing many people. These data files were
  having their patents, but they were either released by the original
  author (and the patent holder) into Public Domain (Cangjie), or the
  patents had expired for several years. We are providing clean-room
  re-generated data files using their ideas (which is not copyrightable,
  and obviously not infringing expired patents).
